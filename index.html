    <h1>
      Introduction
    </h1>

    <p>
      I am a stay at home mom of a 9 year old girl and a 6 year old boy.
      <br>
      Fun fact: I have a master's degree in acting.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Where I'm From
    </h1>

    <p>
      I'm a bit of a geographical mut in that Arizona is the 10th state I have lived in and I have been
      here now for just over 13 years. I mainly grew up in Florida and California.
    </p>

    <h1>
      What are your favorite hobbies?
    </h1>

    <p>
      I like to cook, bike, read, knit, and I am always trying to learn new creative skills like candle making,
      letterpress, pottery, screen printing, etc.
    </p>

    <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>

    <p>
      Quality Control for Luxury Destination Vacations. I would stay in the resorts as a guest and attend all the
      recommended activities such as snorkeling, zip lining, hiking, etc., to make sure the services, comfort and fun
      factors
      were all up to par to the luxury standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      And of course my family will be with me because we have to make sure that they check all the boxes on
      their "family friendly" claims.
    </p>

    <p>
      You know, that was fun. But in reality... my dream job is one where I enjoy the work and the people I work with.
      And most importantly, if one of my children gets sick, or there is a parent-teacher conference or anything where
      they need
      their mom - in my dream job they would understand and not make me feel less-than for also being a mother. In my
      dream job I
      would also be able to work wherever my computer is... so that I don't have to choose between being a good employee
      or a good mom.
      My dream job would allow for both.
    </p>

    <p>
      And that is the reality of what my dream job actually is... and I can't wait to find it!
    </p>

    <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

    <p>Mesa, AZ</p>

    <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>

    <p>
      It has just always really interested me. I love to figure out the "how" of what makes things tick. I've always
      loved starting with nothing... and creating something out of an idea or a guideline or a goal. It is very
      satisfying to
      see it through.
      And a fun puzzle until it gets there.
